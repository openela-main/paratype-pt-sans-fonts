    <p>
      The PT Sans family was developed as part of the “Public Types of Russian
      Federation” project. This project aims at enabling the peoples of Russia to
      read and write their native languages, using free/libre fonts. It is
      dedicated to the 300-year anniversary of the Russian civil type invented by
      Peter the Great from 1708 to 1710, and was realized with financial support
      from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.
     
      PT Sans is a grotesque font based on Russian type designs of the second part
      of the 20th century. However, it also includes very distinctive features of
      modern humanistic design, fulfilling present day aesthetic and functional
      requirements.
